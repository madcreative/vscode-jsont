## 0.2.0 - 2017-02-25
### Added
- Highlighting maintained — mostly — within HTML metablocks (_eg_: within element atributes).

### Changed
- Simplified directives highlighting, particularly around predicates.

### Removed
- Block comments with `{##BEGIN}` and `{##END}` — seems to break or override other patterns. Will work on re-enabling, but for now only line comments are highlighted.
